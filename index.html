It makes sense to a few people, but many of us are left in the dark; overwhelmed and frustrated by the data. On top of that there are a ton of performance tools to choose from; StackProf, RubyProf, AllocationTracer. Where do you even start? While working on speeding up integration tests in Rails source, I learned that the key to improving the performance of Ruby code is having a baseline, not relying on one profiler and understanding the advantages and limitations of your tools. By utilizing these methods, integration tests are now 3 times faster than they were in Rails 4.2.0, with more improvements being made every day. In this talk we will not only look at how to read performance output, but when and how to use the right profilers for the job. We'll discuss a variety of methods and techniques for benchmarking and profiling so you can get the most out of any performance tool.</p></div></li><li class=pg-home-schedule-item><div class=pg-home-schedule-time>11:20AM</div><div class=pg-home-schedule-info><h3 class=no-mar-top><span>Morning Tea</span></h3></div></li><li class=pg-home-schedule-item><div class=pg-home-schedule-time>11:40AM</div><div class=pg-home-schedule-info><h3 class=no-mar-top><span>Home Automation with the Amazon Echo and Ruby</span><span> - </span><span>Zachary Feldman</span></h3><p class="type-secondary js-truncate" data-truncate=340>The Amazon Echo recently debuted and made a big splash with its incredibly accurate voice recognition, capable of hearing and transliterating commands from 20-30 feet away.

While device traffic is encrypted, the device pushes commands to a history page in a web application. Using Watir WebDriver, which normally is used for feature testing, we've created a proxy that can be run on a Raspberry Pi as well as a modular Ruby framework based on Sinatra to run custom commands, allowing us to control the Hue wireless lighting system, Nest, and even request an Uber!</p></div></li><li class=pg-home-schedule-item><div class=pg-home-schedule-time>12:15PM</div><div class=pg-home-schedule-info><h3 class=no-mar-top><span>Micro Break</span></h3></div></li><li class=pg-home-schedule-item><div class=pg-home-schedule-time>12:30PM</div><div class=pg-home-schedule-info><h3 class=no-mar-top><span>Great Caching Disasters!</span><span> - </span><span>Lisa van Gelder</span></h3><p class="type-secondary js-truncate" data-truncate=340>Whenever something has gone seriously wrong for me in production caching has been at the root of it.

Sadly, this product never saw the light of day. Devastated upon hearing this and dreaming about what could have been, a group of engineers (who knew nothing about machine knitting) set out to hack a knitting machine from the 1980's to be computer-controlled, using a tutorial from adafruit as a starting point. Hear about our struggles and triumphs, which ranged from learning to replace knitting machine needles and conduct basic repairs, to emulating a floppy drive and hacking together a custom cable cable to send our own patterns to the machine, to writing our own yarn printer API in ruby/sinatra and printing our first doge meme in yarn. And watch us (LIVE!) as we send images and knit requests to our yarn server, and behold as it knits ugly sweaters from those images! </p></div></li><li class=pg-home-schedule-item><div class=pg-home-schedule-time>12:50PM</div><div class=pg-home-schedule-info><h3 class=no-mar-top><span>Patterns and practices of API design</span><span> - </span><span>Robbie Clutton</span></h3><p class="type-secondary js-truncate" data-truncate=340>Every time I see 'v2' in a URI path I cringe.

Rather than persisting an object in it's current state, event sourcing instead writes an immutable log of deltas (domain events) to the database. from this set of events, an object's state is derived, at any point in the past, simply by replaying the event history sequentially. Event sourcing is a deceptively radical idea which challenges our contemporary notions about transaction processing, while also being a mature pattern with a long history.
