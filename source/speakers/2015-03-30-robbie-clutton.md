bio: From London to New York and back again. Robbie started using Ruby in anger after joining Pivotal Labs in 2012 after years of Java, Scala and a little .NET. Not coding as much as he would like, Robbie now helps run the Pivotal Labs office in London but dabbles in Golang and Clojure when he gets the chance. The best place to find Robbie is on Twitter, @robb1e.
