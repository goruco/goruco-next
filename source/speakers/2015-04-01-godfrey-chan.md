meta: Dropping down to The Metal™
time: 2:15PM
bio: Godfrey Chan is a open-source enthusiast from Vancouver, Canada. He is a co-founder at Brewhouse Software and a member of the Ruby on Rails core team. In his previous life, he was also an award-winning WordPress™ plugin author.
synopsis: As much as we love Ruby, when you need to be really close to the metal, you have no choice but to use JavaScript. This is why I developed the javascript gem to help you harness the raw power of your machines.  In this talk, we will examine the Ruby tricks and black magic hidden behind this ludicrous invention. Along the way, we will learn about how Ruby internally deal with variable lookups, method calls, scoping and bindings. Together, we will push the limits of the Ruby language, taking it to places Matz never ever envisioned!
