title: Patterns and practices of API design
description: "Every time I see 'v2' in a URI path I cringe. This talk will show some alternatives along with discussing some patterns and practices for building robust APIs. Examples will be in Ruby but the talking points will be applicable for any language that creates an API. The talk will cover topics such as versioning, dealing with change, pagination, date times and data modeling."
