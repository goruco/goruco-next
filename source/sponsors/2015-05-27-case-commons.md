Case Commons’ vision is to transform public human services through innovative technology.  To fulfill this vision, we’ve developed a revolutionary Ruby on Rails application called Casebook for child welfare.   Casebook helps caseworkers and administrators make decisions based on data, and is developed using an agile process, in collaboration with agencies and practitioners.
