So, it becomes your part-time job to get them data. As your company grows, this problem only gets worse.</p> <p>We built a (soon to be released as open source) Ruby on Rails app that has completely transformed the way non-technical people at Paperless Post access data. With this 'simple' rails app, we are able to offer sophisticated, on demand, realtime reporting, that takes almost no developer time.</p> <p>The intended audience is anyone who works at a company with ten or more people, where it starts to becomes very painful that non-technical people don't have access to data.</p> <p>I'll go over why the current solutions (often getting a developer to run a database query / lots of cronjobs) don't solve this problem well, and how their shortcomings become incredibly painful as an organization grows.</p> <p>Then, I'll show the tool we built at Paperless Post, which does a really great job solving this problem. It uses some not-commonly-used features of ActiveRecord and erb to take this complicated problem and solve it elegantly.</p> <p>To say this app has made life better at Paperless Post would be an understatement. At the end of the talk, I hope attendees can go back to their companies, implement our tool, and bring more joy and happiness into their lives.</p> <p>Here's a step by step outline of the talk:</p> <ul> <li>The Problem </li> <li>How Most Companies Try To Solve It </li> <li>How Activerecord &amp; erb Create a Better Solution </li> <li>Going Through The Code</li> <li>Dashboards, Visualizations and Complex Reports</li> <li>Deploying The Application </li> <li>The Social &amp; Political Benefits Within Your Company</li> </ul> <h3 id=biography>Biography</h3> <p>Solomon Kahn is in charge of data and analytics at Paperless Post.
