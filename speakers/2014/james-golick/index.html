Probably not. The libraries you're using probably don't work either. If you're lucky, the OS does, but even then you'll probably find something wrong if you look hard enough.</p> <p>Debugging is the reason that the last 20% of shipping a product usually accounts for 80% of the time. And yet, there are a million blog posts and talks about writing code, but very few about figuring out why it doesn't work right once you have.</p> <p>So, how <em>do</em> you find bugs? In this talk I'll explore a set of tools and techniques that have helped me diagnose defects in everything from php code to malloc implementations.</p> <p>One time I even used this strategy to diagnose an outage in a codebase I'd never seen that was written in a language I barely knew and a framework I'd never heard of - in less than 5 minutes. You'll walk away with this talk with everything you need to learn how to debug anything.</p> <h3 id=biography>Biography</h3> <p>My name is James Golick. I write code, build companies, and talk for a living. I also like to snowboard, play golf, stand on my hands, and listen to music, but not professionally.</p> <p>As far as software is concerned, I'm interested in well structured, highly modular code, and scalability / operations (in other words, what actually happens when you put code in to production).</p> <p>I love to write and give talks on the misinformation floating around about building and operating applications at scale. I also release quite a bit of open source software.</p> <p>Get in touch with me via twitter or email!</p> </article></section><div class=clearfix></div></div><footer><p><strong>GORUCO - JUNE 21ST, 2014 AT THE ALTMAN BUILDING IN NYC</strong></p><p>Questions?
